Fort Condor is hard to miss; Just look for a huge condor on top of a blue
reactor. Tell the guard that you're here to help, climb up and inquire about the
situation with the old man at the table. Agree to help them and you're free to
make use of their resources. The shops don't sell anything new, so instead visit
the battlefield overview on the upper left side of Fort Condor.

Talk to the guy in command of the battlefield and he'll tell you how the mini
game works. You also have the option to donate funds, but this isn't necessary.
Tell him you're ready to start the battle.

You can win any Fort Condor battle very easily and very quickly by placing just
one unit (as low as possible on the screen) before starting the battle. As soon
as the battle starts, move the battle speed up to the maximum by pressing R1 and
place a soldier below the other one. Try to place it as low as possible; There's
essentially a red laser line that will mark your territory as you attempt to
place units too low. Repeat this until you can practically place all your units
next to the enemies and secure the bottom area. When all enemies are defeated
before getting help of reinforcements, the battle will be won.

The prize for this first battle is a Magic Comb, a weapon for Red XIII with
Double Materia growth. Any Materia placed in weapons with double growth will
level up twice as fast since they get double the AP gained from battles.

When you're done in Fort Condor, head back to the World Map and travel west.
You can either proceed to Junon now or take the time to meet a potential party
member named Yuffie. She comes with the all-new Throw Materia as added bonus!
